Is it normal to experience anxiety in learning? 

Yes, our lizard brain (amygdala) gets activated when we're challenged in any way - be it good or bad. However, due to a range of variables including experienced-trauma, some people's prefrontal cortyex is overdeveloped. The larger prefrontal cortex means our response to stress is more intense. When the amygdala senses stress from a pressure in the workplace, the response can be similar to being a war soldier going into battle, rather than a simple task assigned to an employee. 

How can we respond to it when it happens? Can we use anxiety to our advantage when we learn?

Yes, I liked what Tim Ferriss said about fears being the ultimate tools for achieving your goals. Define, Prevent, Prepair. If I identify my fears I can list actions for preventing them and repair the things that have resulted from inaction. I liked the cost of innaction part, emotionally physically and financially - I would add relational and spiritual to that. I will be using these strategies.
