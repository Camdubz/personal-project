Assignment One
That I need to be aware of my deffensiveness triggers and plan for 
situations where openmindedness and agreeableness is needed. I've been in a lot of working situations where agressivess is used when communicating, whether in a passive or direct form. The work situations where passive agression was used (sarcasm, belitteling, stonewalling, sabotage to name a few) were horrible. I felt my fight-or-flight response was constantly on when working in unsafe environments. My early warning signs are elevated heart rate, disagreeableness (arguing), raised voice, sweaty palms and frustration. My plan is the 15s quiteness rule, box breathing and ask to be excused so I can take some deep breaths and ground myself by thinking about the best possible outcome for both parties.
